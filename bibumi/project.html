                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>The technology industry is exploring the wonders of virtual and augmented reality, as well as how
                    they are changing the future of our digital and physical experiences. As a result of developments in
                    technology and software, VR and AR have progressed fast in recent years, making them more accessible
                    to a larger audience. These technologies have the potential to dramatically change the way we work,
                    play, learn, and interact with our surroundings.</p>

                <h2>What is Virtual and Augmented Reality ?</h2>
                <p>With the help of Virtual reality (VR), users may fully immerse themselves in a digital world as if
                    they were really there. VR is a revolutionary technology. To create three-dimensional, stereoscopic
                    pictures, VR mostly uses specialized headgear with one high-resolution display for each eye. Due to
                    their near proximity to the user's eyes, these displays provide a broad field of vision, giving the
                    appearance of depth and realism.

                    VR's ability to be interactive and immersive sets it different. The virtual world reacts in
                    real-time thanks to sensors included into the headset, which continually detect the user's head
                    motions and location. With the help of this synchronization, users may glance about and explore the
                    virtual environment just like they would in the real one. By producing 3D sound that shifts
                    direction when the user turns their head, spatial audio technology further improves immersion.

                    VR applications found in a wide range of industries, including design, education, and healthcare. VR
                    provides a degree of immersion in video games that plunges gamers right into the action, allowing
                    them to interact with the setting and characters. By allowing students to tour historical landmarks,
                    carry out virtual experiments, and even enter complicated scientific ideas, it offers fascinating
                    and dynamic learning experiences in the classroom.</p>

            <p>Modern technology known as Augmented reality (AR) enhances our understanding of the actual world by
                overlapping digital data and virtual objects over our field of vision. When using smartphones, tablets,
                or specialized AR glasses, which use cameras and sensors to identify their surroundings and overlay
                digital objects on them.

                The core idea of augmented reality is to deliver timely, relevant information. For instance, if you aim
                your smartphone towards a historical landmark using an AR app, the screen can provide historical details
                and tales about the monument. Alternatively, in a store setting, augmented reality (AR) enables you to
                visually try on clothes or see how furniture would fit in your house.

                One of the most well-known applications of AR is the mobile game Pokémon Go, which introduced digital
                characters into the real world and sparked a worldwide craze. But AR goes well beyond gaming,
                demonstrating its adaptability in maintenance, education, and healthcare. In the educational setting,
                augmented reality (AR) turns conventional textbooks and learning materials into interactive experiences
                that make subjects more interesting and understandable. Medical experts employ augmented reality (AR)
                for surgeries and diagnostics, while maintenance personnel may use enhanced instructions to make
                difficult jobs simpler.</p>

            <h2>Application work VR and AR</h2>
            <p>Virtual reality (VR) rhythm game called Beat Sabre was created by Beat Games. It provides a
                straightforward yet incredibly physically demanding and physically addicting game experience. Players of
                Beat Sabre put on a VR headset and use two virtual lightsabers. The goal is to slice these coloured
                blocks with the appropriate sabre (blue for the left hand, red for the right) in the direction given
                while simultaneously evading obstacles as they rhythmically approach the player in time with the beat of
                the music. The game's genius resides in its simple gameplay, which makes it usable by players of all
                ability levels. There is something for everyone in Beat Saber's enormous music collection, which
                includes a wide variety of genres and allows users to contribute their own tunes. Players may compete
                for top scores on leader-boards, giving the experience a competitive aspect. The intensity of the game
                offers an amazing exercise while still being immensely fun. Beat Sabre, which offers a wide variety of
                personalisation possibilities, has won over VR aficionados and continues to highlight the technology's
                potential for producing exhilarating and captivating gaming experiences.

                A smartphone augmented reality (AR) game called Pokemon Go was created and released by Niantic in
                association with Nintendo and The Pokemon Company. When it was released in July 2016, it immediately
                spread around the world, fusing the adored Pokemon universe with smartphone and augmented reality (AR)
                exploration.
                In order to find and catch virtual Pokemon species, users must first explore their real-world
                surroundings in Pokemon Go. The game creates an augmented reality experience using the GPS and camera of
                the smartphone. Different Pokemon species display on users' screens as they walk around in the real
                world, superimposed onto the setting using the phone's camera. Players must physically travel to the
                places where these species are present, such as parks, landmarks, and other sites of interest, in order
                to catch them. By building a feeling of community through elements like team-based gaming and
                collaborative activities, the game promotes social engagement.
                Millions of gamers have been inspired by Pokemon Go to explore their neighbourhood, public areas, and
                monuments in pursuit of Pokemon, which has had a tremendous influence on mobile gaming. It stimulates
                outdoor exploration and physical exertion, fostering a fit and active lifestyle. Players are interested
                and enthusiastic about new features and content thanks to the game's frequent updates and events.</p>
